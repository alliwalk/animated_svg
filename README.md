A very simple animated SVG project

Got an email from Code School about SVGs and animation, so I decided to try it. I got the tips for how to do this type of animation from How SVG Line Animation Works over at CSS-Tricks. All of the animation is handled via a few lines in the CSS file. That's right - no Javascript! A more complicated SVG would require far more complicated CSS as well as Javascript.

The about section contains details about the styling of the site.
