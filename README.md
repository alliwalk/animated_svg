A very simple animated SVG project

Find this project at http://www.alliwalk.com/animated_svg/

Got an email from Code School about SVGs and animation, so I decided to try it. I got the tips for how to do this type of animation from How SVG Line Animation Works over at CSS-Tricks.

Color Scheme
The color scheme was created at Coolers.co
Background
The background pattern is called Checkered Pattern at Subtle Patterns.
Fonts
The h1 and h3 fonts are Chango and Lora, respectively.
Custom Navbar
The Bootstrap navbar was colorized with TWBSColor.
